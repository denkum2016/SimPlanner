# SimManager (Medical Simulation Course Planning, Participant Confirmation and Reporting)
A web based application to coordinate running a hospital simulation program - development phase

uses BreezeJs & Angular, based on John Papa's Hot-Towel template

###To Do
- [ ] Sim Team to give current version a full test
- [ ] Enable Migrations and move to live data
- [ ] Test saving and subsequently changing/saving different combination of scenario & manequin for a given course slot
- [ ] Add Contact us page
- [ ] Add How To Use This Site page
- [ ] Add Edit My Details page
- [ ] Add Change My Password page
- [ ] Add Manequin service dates/cost table
- [ ] Add list of all participants, filerable by course participation
- [ ] ?Add ISO currency field to culture record (on create) until supported in Angular localisation
- [ ] Enable bower as per [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31872622/using-grunt-bower-gulp-npm-with-visual-studio-2015-for-a-asp-net-4-5-project)
- [ ] Pretty up draggable interaction 1) css class for colour change on receiving element 2)giving and receiving elements to have the same width
- [ ] Print format of course roles page &/or use migradoc to allow user to edit RTF file
- [ ] Check availability of manequins in course roles
- [ ] Check previous scenario & resource exposure for participants in course roles
- [ ] enable sign in with social media beyond facebook
- [ ] reset facebook clientId key
- [ ] Course participant/faculty notification chron & method (email/text)

###Desired Features
- [ ] Courses with 'faculty present throughout' & 'faculty only present for slots listed'. I guess being a course organiser in the latter would mean he/she present throughout - perhaps 'visitor checkbox'
- [ ] Department/Institution Reports
- [ ] multi-stream courses with faculty/participants split into different rooms (tabbed on course roles form)
- [ ] discuss with potential users re ways of splitting eg red/blue groups & ways of presenting in workable UI
